## What
> Give a brief description of the component or pattern you want to propose.

## Why
> Explain why you think this should be added to the VA.gov design system.
>
> - What evidence do you have that it's needed by multiple services across VA?
> - What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of the users of those services?
> - Have you checked that it doesn't already exist in the VA.gov Design System? 

## Anything else
> Include links to any examples, research or code to support your proposal, if available.

## Next steps
You may present your work to the Design System Council at an upcoming meeting. If you do not or cannot attend the Design Council Meeting, you can opt to get an asynchronous approval. 

Submit requests to join an upcoming Design System Council meeting in #vsp-design-system.  

During the meeting, the Design System Council Working Group will evaluate the request and make a decision. 

If your request is approved, you can add your component/pattern to the [Experimental Design section](https://design.va.gov/experimental-design/) of design.va.gov. If you have any questions on how to add your component/pattern to the Experimental section, please reach out to the Design System Team at #vsp-design-system.
