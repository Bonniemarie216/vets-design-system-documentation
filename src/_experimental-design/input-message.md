# Input message

This input message is variation of our validation message pattern. It provides helpful, in-context information about an input, either before or immediately after a Veteran interacts with an input (e.g. on a form input that auto-saves). 

**Informational**

**Success**

**Warning**

**Error**

### Examples

- [Mock-up demonstrating use case of a Veteran who has never updated their settings](https://preview.uxpin.com/51ca6ecd7ddaf2ceaf75f94e2b2ccbed2a193f6d#/pages/140948867/simulate/sitemap?mode=i).
  - All field sets are interactive
  - Last fieldset demonstrates error state

## Usability 

### When to use this variation

This message pattern is a mobile friendly, in-line way to communicate information about inputs. It was developed to entice users to take an action on an optional input, and has 4 states:

- Success (green) communicates the successful update of information, via an API call
- Warning (yellow) draws attention to an input, usually before an API call is made.
- Error (red) communicates the failure of an update of information, via an API call
- Information (blue)  draws attention to an input, usually before an API call is made.

### When to consider something else

If you need to tell the Veteran they've missed a required field on an application, or they've entered data in the wrong format, use the [current error pattern](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-radiobuttons--error) instead.

### How to use Input Messages

- Keep message content short.
- Use the [feedback icons](https://design.va.gov/design/icons#feedback) from the design system.
- Use the success, warning, error states on forms that don't require the user to click a button to submit the form.

### Other input message styles

#### Error messages 

- When a user is filling out an online application, use the [current error pattern](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-radiobuttons--error) when a user has 
  - missed a required field
  - entered data incorrectly

## Accessibility considerations

- Icon needs to have alternative text (use sr-only text or an aria-label) so screen readers have an equivalent understanding of the purpose/nature of the message.

- When the message changes after a user interacts with an input, use `aria-live="polite"` to announce the change.

## Research findings 

- No research conducted as of 8/16/21.
- Internal usability study with colleagues who are also Veterans planned for late Aug/early Sept 2021.
- External study planned for notification settings post-MVP Oct/Nov 2021.
