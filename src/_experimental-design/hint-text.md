When a detailed form input label is not enough to convey the meaning or purpose of the input, we have three options for including additional information:

## Inline with the label 
This should be used in the case where the needed clarification is very short.
### Example:
Date (MM/DD/YYY)
Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)

## As subtext beneath the label
This should be used in the case where the needed clarification is a little longer, but less than two sentences. These should likely not wrap more than twice for a total of three lines. 
### Example:
Phone number / We will only call you if we need more information about your application
Utility / For example: electricity, gas, water, sewer

## Within an Additional Info component 
This should be used in cases where the needed clarification is long or complex, requiring more than two sentences, multiple paragraphs, or special formatting, such as bullet points or links.
