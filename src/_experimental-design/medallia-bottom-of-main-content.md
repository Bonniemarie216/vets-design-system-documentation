# Medallia Bottom of Main Content Button


## VSP Contact Center


### Purpose

The current Medallia feedback button presents 508 and mobile issues. A proposed solution is moving the button from being sticky to the right side of the browser window to the bottom of the main content. Moving this resolves the current 508 and mobile issues.


### Description

There is currently a number of items that may potentially live at the bottom of the main content of many VA.gov pages—the last updated date, and the Back to Top button. The approved designs place the Medallia feedback button amongst those items.

Note: the above mobile design does not address a current bug in the “last updated” text. Currently, the last updated text has no left margin. However, it should utilize the standard padding-left: .5em that is in place on the ‘article.’

### Guidance (if available)

Though not all of the bottom of main elements will not be present on every page, the space they occupy should be retained even while absent. In doing so, this will ensure all proper spacing is retained around potentially obstructing elements (such as the pagination or Need more help sections illustrated in the Sketch file). This will also create an expectation for page feedback location, which will be beneficial for the future development of a global feedback mechanism that will be located at the bottom of the main content.
