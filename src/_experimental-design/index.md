# Experimental Design

<div class="va-introtext">
Welcome to the Experimental Design section. This is where we document experimental components that are currently being built and validated by team members across VA.gov</div>

## What is an experimental component?
An experimental component is one that is being explored by a team on VA.gov, but has not yet been validated sufficiently by our Veterans and caregivers to become an official design system component.

## Why showcase experimental components?
Since our community has many people across different contracts and companies building on VA.gov, we often have teams trying out new component designs. However, before this, there was no place for folks to get visibility into what was happening, resulting in team members working on the same problem spaces without being aware that that was the case.

Additionally, we wanted to create a light-weight process where teams building applications could contribute back to our design system.

## Can I use an experimental component in my application?
Yes. However, if you are using an experimental component, be aware that it hasn’t necessarily been fully validated. If you are using one, please document any research you’ve done on it’s component page for others to see.

## How do I add an experimental component here?
To get a component into our experimental system, follow steps 1-4 in [the process written up here](https://design.va.gov/documentation/contributing-to-the-design-system)
