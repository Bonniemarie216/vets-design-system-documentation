# Experimental Design

<div class="va-introtext">
Welcome to the Experimental Design section. This is where we document experimental components and patterns that are currently being built and validated by team members across VA.gov</div>

## What is an experimental component or pattern?
An experimental component or pattern is something that is being explored by a team on VA.gov, but has not yet been validated sufficiently by our Veterans and caregivers to become an official design system component or pattern.

## Why showcase experimental components and patterns?
Since our community has many people across different contracts and companies building on VA.gov, we often have teams trying out new component or pattern designs. However, before this, there was no place for folks to get visibility into what was happening, resulting in team members working on the same problem spaces without being aware that that was the case.

Additionally, we wanted to create a light-weight process where teams building applications could contribute back to our design system.

## Can I use an experimental component or pattern in my application?
Yes. However, if you are using an experimental component or pattern, be aware that it hasnâ€™t necessarily been fully validated. Please include any research you have done on the experimental component or pattern on its documentation page for others to see.

## How do I add an experimental component or pattern here?
To get a component or pattern into our experimental system, follow steps 1-4 in [the process written up here]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/contributing-to-the-design-system)
