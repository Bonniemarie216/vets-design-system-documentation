* **Use explicit and specific words for actions.** We prefer "upload" and "delete" as those words describe exactly what will happen when you tap or click.
  * **Upload instead of add.** Use the word "Upload" instead of "Add". For example, "Upload file" and "Upload another file". 
  * **Delete instead of remove.** Use the word "Delete" instead of "Remove". For example, "Delete file". Also, do not use "Edit" unless the uploaded file can actually be edited in place. "Edit" is not appropriate for an uploaded file if the user has to delete and re-upload the file.
* **Use file instead of document.** File is the broadest term and thus preferable to "document" as that may be too specific when images, text files, and other file types may be acceptable for upload.
* **Follow messaging guidance.** Follow the [feedback messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/feedback) in the messages dictionary for file upload success and failure.
