Links should tell people what action to take, where to go next, or what information to expect when they select the link.

- Use natural and descriptive language.
- Add links on a separate line to help make them stand out.
- Be selective when choosing links. Too many links can overwhelm users.
- Describe the purpose and target (destination) of the link.
- Donâ€™t make the link so long that the relevant words get lost.
- Avoid "Click here" as the CTA text.
- Avoid generic CTA links like "Learn more," "See more," and "Read more" by themselves. 
- Don't punctuate standalone CTA links. Exception: When the link text is a question.
- When a link opens a PDF, YouTube video, XLS or other file format, [use the appropriate link variation]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/#variations).

### Embedded text links vs. CTA links

__Avoid embedded text links within body copy__

Embedded text links are hyperlinks that are part of running text in body copy. Embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to readers with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments, so we try not to use them. 

__Use CTA links to call out actions__

CTA links are standalone hyperlinks that are calls to an action, but that don't warrant a [primary button CTA]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/button-labels). 

We generally reserve button CTAs to launch an application, to sign in, or other primary, essential action on a page. But there are other kinds of actions that may call for a CTA as a text link, like downloading a form, learning about important information (like eligibility or copay rates, etc.).
