# Web policies and directives

We follow federal standards as well as VA policies for designing, maintaining, and supporting digital services including:

- VA.gov  

- Subdomains

- Our intranet

- Other channels like videos, social media, and more

To learn about these and other important policies&mdash;including [508 requirements for accessibility](https://www.va.gov/web/standards/accessibility.cfm)&mdash;and how to implement them for digital experiences you’re creating, visit the VA Web Governance site.


## [VA Web Governance site](https://digital.va.gov/web-governance/)

Be sure to visit regularly. We update the governance site when federal regulations, VA policies, or standards change.

### [Primary VA policies](https://digital.va.gov/web-governance/standards-and-policies/governing-va-and-federal-policies/)

__VA Directive 6102.__ The directive documents the policies for digital experiences, no matter where they’re hosted. The information in the directive applies to all organizations within VA. 

__VA Handbook 6102.__ The handbook includes both federal and VA requirements for establishing and administering VA internet and intranet services. The handbook provides standards on how to implement the policies in the directive.
