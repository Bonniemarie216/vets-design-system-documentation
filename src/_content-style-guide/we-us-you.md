# We, us, you

When referring to VA, use the first-person pronoun (we, us, our). Use the second person (you, your) to refer to Veterans, service members, family members, and other audiences we're addressing. This aligns with our [content principles]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/content-principles) to speak person-to-person with our customers rather than talking about them.
