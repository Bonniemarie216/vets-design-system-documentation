# Trademarks

There's no specific legal guidance for VA trademarks, but we follow this general practice on the web. For VA program or benefit names that are registered trademarks:

- Include the symbol in the first prominent mention, only once and only on the relevant section of the website.

- Don't use the symbol in links, buttons, breadcrumbs, or navigation labels. 

  

**Example:**

For the GI Bill trademark, we  include the symbol on the [Education and training](https://www.va.gov/education/) hub landing page. 

In the scenario where there is no appropriate place on the hub landing page, we would instead include the symbol on its [About the GI Bill benefits](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/) page. (But not both.)

Don't include it on a disability, careers, pension, or other page where we might mention the GI Bill.
