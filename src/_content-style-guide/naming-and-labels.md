# Naming and labels

Most tools, products, benefits, offices, and programs don’t need a brand name or branded label. In line with the [VA Graphics Standards against custom logos](https://design.va.gov/design/logos), we also don't create "brand clutter" with unnecessary branding. 

**Don't create new brands**

Branded names and labels: 
-	Force internal jargon on customers. 
-	Spawn unnecessary sub-brands and create confusion for Veterans. 
-	Are expensive and time-consuming to market in order to educate customers on what they mean. 

Check the [word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list) for tools, benefits, and programs that are OK to capitalize.

## Use descriptive plain language labels

If you need to call your tool, program, or benefit something, call it what it is. Use everyday, plain language words that people already understand.

This follows our [content principles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles), is easier to understand without explanatory information, and is [better for SEO](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo). 

In the example below, there's no need to brand education benefits with the internal line of business because all Veteran benefits are through VA. Likewise, on-the-job training doesn't need to be made into a brand or a branded, uncommon acronym.

In the examples below, branded labels hide critical information. Using a descriptive plain language label helps the user find the task or information they're looking for.

## Don't create acronyms to use like a brand name

Many government organizations rely on acronyms as shorthand in internal communications, but that doesn't mean we should make customers learn our internal jargon. 

Don’t create new [acronyms](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/abbreviations-and-acronyms) in Veteran-facing content that aren't commonly used and understood by them already. When in doubt, refer to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com) or AP Style. Likewise, don't use internal acronyms in Veteran-facing content like they're brand names.

**Avoid “alphabet soup” syndrome**

Internal acronyms used like branded names are:
- Hard to understand by customers and people outside your business or team.
-	Sound like Government, not human.
-	Don’t align with our [content principles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles).
