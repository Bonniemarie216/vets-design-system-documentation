# Form labels

When adapting a paper form into an online application or tool on VA.gov, content writers and UX designers should consult our [Form labels]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/form-labels) to see if a standardized label has already been created. Use the existing standardized labels when building a form rather than create new or custom labels with each new form.

The masterlist documents labels and questions that appear on our online forms. This list is continually updated as more forms are brought online and new field labels and form questions are documented.

See the [Form label masterlist]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/form-labels) for a detailed list of VA.gov standardized form labels and questions.

Because form fields have a lot of visual design and formatting that can affect copy, this masterlist is also included in the design section.
