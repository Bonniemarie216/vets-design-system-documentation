When writing about substance use and substance use disorder, the words we use matter. This is true
both in content for Veterans as well as in our treatment plans, policies, and other documents. Research
shows that stigmatizing language can make it harder for people with substance use disorder to seek
treatment. It can also negatively shape the perspectives of the people providing treatment in a way that
negatively impacts the care they provide.
