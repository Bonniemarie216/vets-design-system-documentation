# Form confirmation page:
 
The form confirmation page gives users information about what they can expect after they submit an online application. This page also provides users a summary of the benefit they applied for, a confirmation number, and the date they submitted their claim.

Our current confirmation pages vary in format and content. Below are some of the default components on our current confirmation pages. Teams should tailor the layout and content as needed based on the benefit type and/or stakeholder feedback.

The form confirmation page consists of:

A. H1 (should carry over from H1 from the online form)  
B. Success alert   
C. Print this page pattern  
D. Other content elements  
E. Action link  
F. Helpful content  

## H1

File for [benefit] or Apply for [benefit] and the VA paper form equivalency appears next to or below the H1.

Example:  
File for disability compensation (Form 21-526EZ)

## Success alert 

![success alert]({{site.baseurl}}/success-alert.png) 

Use a [success alert](https://design.va.gov/components/alertboxes) to let your user know that they’ve successfully submitted their form. Content for the success alert depends on the form.

Example messages of success alerts on other form confirmation pages:

**You’ve successfully submitted your application.**
Once we’ve reviewed your application, a Caregiver Support Coordinator will contact you to discuss next steps. 

**Your order has been submitted.**
We’ll send an email confirming your order to **email.va.gov.**

## Print this page pattern 

![print this page pattern]({{site.baseurl}}/images/print-this-page.png) 

The print this page pattern consists of the [Featured content component](https://design.va.gov/components/featured-content), content, and a “Print this page” default blue button. 

Print this page pattern consists of:
- Benefit they’ve applied for
- Applicant name
- Confirmation number (if applicable)
- The date that claim or application was submitted
- Other important information about their claim, such as disability conditions, they’re claiming. (if applicable)
- “Print this page” default blue button

## Other content elements 
What other content to include on the confirmation page depends on the type of benefit. Some benefit confirmation pages might need more information than others.

Content writers and designers should work together to determine the best format and content for the confirmation page, based on the type of benefit and stakeholder input.

Some examples of other content or questions we might want to include on a form's confirmation page are:
- What happens after I apply? 
- How long will it take VA to process the application?
- What can the applicant do while they wait?
- Are there any actions the applicant needs to take while they wait?
- What can the applicant do if they have additional questions after they apply?
 
## Action link

![confirmation page action link]({{site.baseurl}}/images/confirmation-page-action-link.png) 

 The action link guides the user back to the VA.gov homepage. 

## Helpful content

![need help content]({{site.baseurl}}/images/need-help.png) 

Helpful content varies depending on form to form. Use the H3 highlight for the title and always label it “Need help?”. The content usually points the user to a number they can call if they need help with their form.
