# Dividers
 
Dividers are thin lines that create vertical separation between sections of content on a page. 

## Examples

## Usage

### When to use Dividers

Consider using a Divider:

- To signify a change in topic, content type, or expected interaction. Example: using a divider to visually separate interactive search controls from a list of search results. 
- To create visual separation between chunks of content in a sequence. Dividers can help users distinguish between blocks of similar content at-a-glace. Example: using dividers to create separation between VA locations in the Facility locator tool.  

### When to consider something else

- Avoid using dividers between short, discrete items that are in close proximity with one another. Divider overuse will clutter the page. Consider using vertical white space instead to create separation.  

### Layout and style

Horizontal dividers span the width of their container.
