Within our design philosophy of "[Keep it simple](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-service-handbook/resources/design#design-philosophy)" for users we state:

> Limit the number of decisions a Veteran needs to make in one screen. We usually try to keep the number of questions under five. Two or three is even better.

The sub-task pattern provides guidance on how to "keep it simple". 

## Usage

### When to use this pattern

* **Secondary tasks before a flow.** When we need to ask users a series of questions to determine the best path forward for them. For example, [branching eligibility choices]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/benefit-applications#f-optional-sub-task-pattern-for-branching-eligibility-choices). When there are multiple benefits that branch out depending upon user response the sub-task pattern can guide the user to the appropriate benefit application.
* **Short task within a larger process.** When we need the user to complete a shorter task, one that can be accomplished with a few questions, within a larger process that may span touchpoints.

#### Design principles

**[One thing per page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page)** is a design principle that is employed when structuring forms. The "thing" can be:

* One piece of information youâ€™re telling a user
* One decision a user has to make
* One question a user has to answer

That one decision or question may require more than one input from the user as they fill out a form. However, by following this pattern you can [reduce the cognitive load](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) required to complete the form by focusing the user on a specific question and its answer.

### When not to use this pattern

* **In place of a standard form.** This pattern does not replace a standard form flow and layout. This pattern exists within a larger flow or process, not by itself. Thus it would be inappropriate to create a form flow that does not have a Progress bar - Segmented, Button pair, and other components found in a typical form flow.

### When to use caution

* **List and loop.** While it is possible, and encouraged, to explore a "One thing per page" principle using this pattern along with the List and loop pattern, it has not yet been validated on VA.gov. If you are interested in combining these patterns please work with the Design System Team to define a research plan.

**Additional Usage sub-sections may include:**
- Inputs and outputs
- How to tell users
- When to tell users
- Do & Don't

## Examples

### Other relevant examples

* **beta.ssa.gov** The [Check eligibility for Social Security benefits](https://beta.ssa.gov/prepare/check-eligibility-for-benefits) flow is a preparation step ahead of applying for benefits and uses the "One thing per page" principle throughout.
