## Usage

### When to use this pattern

**When you are collecting information from users on a long form.** The pattern provides the user with a printable record of their submission. A printed record provides a reference for future use and helps to confirm a successful form submission.

## Examples
### Confirmation page summary
![confirmation page summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/patterns/help-users-to/confirmation-page.png)

### Print preview of confirmation page summary

![print preview of confirmation page summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/patterns/help-users-to/print-view-page2.png)


## How to design and build
### How this pattern works

- **Create a summary of submitted information.** Include a title for the summary page. An example message is: *Your application information*
- **Include a recap of submitted information.** Include the applicant's name and date of application.
- **Inform users to print the confirmation for their records.** Notify users that they can print or download their application information. An example message is: *You can print this confirmation page for your records. You can also download your completed application as a PDF.*
- **Include a "Print this page" button.** A printed record provides a reference for future use. The "Print this page" button appears at the bottom of the summary page.
- **Include a link to download the completed application in PDF format.** The download link appears below the "Print this page" button.
