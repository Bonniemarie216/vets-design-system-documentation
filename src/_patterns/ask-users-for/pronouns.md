## Usage

### When to use this pattern

* **When you need to collect a person's pronouns in order to address them appropriately.** A pronoun is a word that can be used to refer to a person you are addressing (i.e. "you") or being talked about in the third person (i.e. "she/her," "he/him," and "they/them"). Some pronouns are gendered (i.e. "she/her" and "he/him") and thus we are intentional about the way we use pronouns in order to be respectful and inclusive. A pronoun can be indicative of how a person identifies or prefers to be addressed. Allowing users to choose their pronouns and using those pronouns, when not addressing a person by their name, creates a more comfortable interaction.

## Examples

{% include component-example.html alt="Asking for pronouns in the VA.gov Profile." file="/images/patterns/ask-users-for/pronouns/pronouns-profile.jpg" caption="Asking for pronouns in the VA.gov Profile, personal information section." width="75%" %}

## How to design and build 

### How this pattern works

* **Give Veterans the option of picking more than one pronoun they could identify with.** Use checkboxes so that Veterans can identify with multiple descriptions.
* **Provide a way to opt-out of answering.** A checkbox labeled "Use my preferred name" should be provided.
