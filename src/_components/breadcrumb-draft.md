# Breadcrumbs

<p class="va-introtext">The breadcrumb is a sitewide navigation component that shows users where they are in the site and gives them a way to navigate up a level in the site hierarchy or backwards in a flow. In addition, the breadcrumb tells search engines how the site is structured, and it can be displayed in search results. This can improve rankings, and provide users with additional context. </p>

- Use a breadcrumb when it is important to the user to understand where they are in the site, and have the ability to navigate up the hierarchy. 

### When not to use

- Do not use a breadcrumb on the top page of a site (i.e. the home page). 
- Do not use a breadcrumb if the path or hierarchy of the page is irrelevant to the user or experience. 
- Do not use a breadcrumb for products that have a flat structure (i.e. only 2 levels of content or less)

- The breadcrumb should be placed below the header and above the main content.


### Behavior
