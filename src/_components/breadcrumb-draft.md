# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumb is a sitewide navigation component that shows users where they are in the site and gives them a way to navigate up a level in the site hierarchy or backwards in a flow. In addition, the breadcrumb tells search engines how the site is structured, and it can be displayed in search results. This can improve rankings, and provide users with additional context.
