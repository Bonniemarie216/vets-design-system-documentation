## Example

### Stars

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-divider--default-story" %}

## Usage

### When to use divider

- To signify a change in topic, content type, or expected interaction.
- To create visual separation between chunks of content. Divider can help users distinguish between blocks of similar content at-a-glace.  

### When to consider something else

- Avoid using divider between short, individual items that are in close proximity with one another, _unless_ they are separating navigation links. Consider using white space or headers instead to create vertical separation.  
- Use a background color box or card to separate a chunk of interactive elements, like search controls, from a list of search results.
