# Dividers
 
Dividers are thin lines that create separation between sections of content on a page. 

## Examples

### Stars

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-horizontal-rules--default-story" %}

## Usage

### When to use dividers

Consider using a divider:

- To signify a change in topic, content type, or expected interaction.
- To create visual separation between chunks of content. Dividers can help users distinguish between blocks of similar content at-a-glace.  

### When to consider something else

- Dividers are most effective when used infrequently. Avoid using dividers between short, individual items that are in close proximity with one another, unless the dividers are separating navigation links. Consider using white space or headers instead to create vertical separation.  
- Use a gray (background color) box to separate a chunk of interactive elements, like search controls, from a list of results.
