# Horizontal rules
 
Dividers are thin lines that create separation between sections of content on a page. 

## Examples

### Stars

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-horizontal-rules--default-story" %}

## Usage

### When to use horizontal rules

- To signify a change in topic, content type, or expected interaction.
- To create visual separation between chunks of content. Horizontal rules can help users distinguish between blocks of similar content at-a-glace.  

### When to consider something else

- Avoid using horizontal rules between short, individual items that are in close proximity with one another, _unless_ they are separating navigation links. Consider using white space or headers instead to create vertical separation.  
- Use a gray (background color) box to separate a chunk of interactive elements, like search controls, from a list of search results.
