# Additional info

<div class="va-introtext" markdown="1">
Additional Info components are interactive components that reveal and hide content from the page.

## Guidance

Use the Additional Info component to provide contextual help on a form in order to bring clarity to interactions. 

Review the [supplemental content pattern guidelines](https://design.va.gov/patterns/supplemental-content) for how to use it, and what type of content to include.
