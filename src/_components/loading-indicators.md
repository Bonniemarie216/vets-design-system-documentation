# Loading indicators

<div class="va-introtext" markdown="1">
The indeterminate loading indicator communicates to the end user that a page is in the process of loading.</div>

## Example

{% include storybook-preview.html height="150px" story="components-va-loading-indicator--default" %}

## Usage

### When to use the Indeterminate loading indicator

* When the wait time for a process, such as loading a page, is unknown. The Indeterminate loading indicator can appear with or without a text label.

### When to consider something else

* Use the [Standard progress bar](https://design.va.gov/components/progress-bars) for file uploads where the wait time is determinate.
* Use the [Segmented progress bar](https://design.va.gov/components/progress-bars) in forms to communicate the number of steps required to complete the form.

## Accessibility considerations
