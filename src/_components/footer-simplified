The simplified footer notifies Veterans that they are on a VA website. It doesn’t contain some aspects of the standard footer, such as link lists and superlinks, in order to reduce the chances of users leaving a form or process (that doesn’t support finishing the form later) before completing all the required steps.

## Examples

### Default

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-va-component-name--default" link_text=page.web-component %}

- [Abstract mobile example](https://share.goabstract.com/3033a7fe-ebfc-4335-966c-dba88c5b3e0d?collectionLayerId=fbbcfaff-aa55-4b17-a059-e1dec3a8c628&mode=design&sha=109f562d8b1492b31d56ce235aef4f39abac2d0c)
  - Note to DST: We assume that the crisis line banner will remain even though it isn’t shown in the current Abstract.

## Usage
- The simplified footer should be used with the simplified header component and not used without it.

### When to use Footer - Simplified

Reduce the cognitive load required to complete a form or process that doesn’t support finishing it later, is time-sensitive, and/or is not part of the VA.gov sitewide information architecture or include a related navigation pattern on the page.
